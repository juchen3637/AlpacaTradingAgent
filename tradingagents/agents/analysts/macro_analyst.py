**Date:** {state.get('trade_date', 'Unknown')}
**Error:** {str(e)}
**Duration:** {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds

## Error Details
The macro economic analysis encountered an error and could not complete successfully. This may be due to:
- FRED API rate limits or timeouts
- Network connectivity issues  
- Missing API keys (FRED_API_KEY required)
- Invalid date ranges or data unavailability

## General Market Guidance
⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Unable to perform detailed macro economic analysis.

### Manual Check Recommendations
- Monitor Federal Reserve policy updates manually
- Check recent CPI and employment data releases
- Observe Treasury yield curve for inversion signals
- Watch VIX levels for market volatility assessment
- Review latest FOMC meeting minutes

### General Trading Implications
- **Rising Rate Environment**: Favor financials, pressure growth stocks
- **Inflation Concerns**: Consider commodity exposure, real assets
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Increase defensive positioning
- **Market Volatility**: Adjust position sizing accordingly
